// `getSrpVerifier` was once a stub that threw, and nothing noticed: it is the
// only part of the SDK a public link reaches and nothing else calls it, so
// every photo link failed while the rest of sharing worked. These pin down that
// it asks the server for a modulus and hands one back.
//
// The verifier itself is not computed here. It is derived from a modulus Proton
// signs, and the signature is checked, so there is no fixture to compute it
// from short of a live account.

// Base64 on typed arrays is still a proposal, and the SRP helpers use it. The
// server loads this same polyfill on start, so loading it here is what the
// module would find running for real.
