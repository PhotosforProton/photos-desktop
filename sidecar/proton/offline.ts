// Photos kept available offline.
//
// Marking a photo keeps its full-resolution original inside the app's own directory,
// sealed with the vault key like every other blob the store holds. Nothing is written
// to the Explorer sync root: this is the app's own copy, and the mount is a separate
// feature the user opts into on its own.
//
// Two pieces of state, both sealed and both belonging to exactly one account:
//   - the list of pinned uids (`offline.enc`), so a pin survives a restart, and
//   - one blob per photo under `originals/`, keyed by the uid's hash.
// `wipeCache` drops both, so sign-out and a password change take them with everything
// else. Nothing here is readable, or even loadable, while the vault is locked.
//
// The downloads run off the JSON-RPC channel the way a save-to-folder run does: `pin`
// returns at once and the UI polls `offlineStatus`, so a large batch never holds the
// single channel that the rest of the app is waiting on.
