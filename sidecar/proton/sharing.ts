// Sharing: who else can reach a photo or an album, and the one string in this
// app that must never be written down.
//
// A public link's URL ends in `#<secret>`, and that fragment is the decryption
// key itself: it never travels to the server, and the link is worthless without
// it. So the URL is carried whole, handed to the user intact, and never logged,
// neither whole nor in part. A link's custom password is the second secret here:
// it arrives to be set, goes straight to the SDK, and turns back into a single
// boolean before anything leaves this module. The same goes for the addresses
// invited here. A failure leaves behind the operation and the error's kind and
// nothing else, so the log stays sendable; `noteFailure` sets out exactly what
// that means.
//
// Drive offers two shapes of sharing and does not offer both everywhere. A photo
// takes a public link (anyone holding the URL) and named invitations; an album
// takes invitations only, because the server refuses a public URL on an album
// share. `supportsPublicLink` carries that split up to the view, so it never
// offers a button the server would answer with an error.
//
// Public links are encrypted to the owner's own address key, so Proton grants
// them only on a volume the user owns. `canShare` settles that here rather than
// letting the SDK throw at someone who merely opened a photo shared with them.
