// Albums: reading them, and changing them.
//
// The SDK owns the album tree (`iterateAlbumUids` / `iterateAlbum`), so this
// module stays a thin layer over it. Four SDK constraints shape the rest.
//
// A photo count and a cover are only true if they come from the albums endpoint.
// The SDK carries both on the album node as well, but a node is served from an
// in-memory cache that only refreshes when something marks it stale, and the
// mount's own album walk re-caches nodes behind the user's back. `iterateAlbums`
// reads the node and would hand back whatever that pass happened to see;
// `iterateAlbumUids` reads the endpoint, which always reflects the current
// state, and folds the count, the cover and the activity time into the cached
// node on the way past. So the uids come from there and the node is only asked
// for the name, which is the part that has to be decrypted.
//
// Adding and removing take the whole photo array. The server caps a request at
// ten and the SDK batches to that itself, so chunking here would only fight its
// accounting — an accounting the two do differently. Adding spends the ten on
// links, and a photo brings its related parts (a live photo's video, a motion
// photo's frames) along for the ride, so ten photos can be more than one
// request. Removing does not reach for those parts, and spends the ten on the
// photos themselves.
//
// Removal reports per batch, not per photo. The API answers once for the whole
// request, so the SDK marks every uid in a failed batch failed. The counts hold
// (a request that failed removed nothing), but the blame does not: which photo
// sank the batch is not knowable, so callers report totals and never accuse one.
// Adding does better, because there the API answers per link.
//
// Deleting an album skips the trash. Photos already on the timeline survive it,
// but photos that live only in the album do not, so `deleteAlbum` reports that
// case back instead of guessing which way the user meant it.
