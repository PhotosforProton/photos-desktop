// Trash: what was trashed, putting it back, and the one action the app cannot
// undo.
//
// Every call here is scoped to the photos volume, because the SDK resolves the
// volume from the client's own root share: `emptyTrash` on the Photos client
// reaches the photos trash and cannot touch My files.
//
// Restore and delete report per node the way `trashNodes` does, so one node's
// failure never sinks the batch. The SDK owns the batching (100 uids a request)
// and pages the listing itself, so neither is this module's job.
