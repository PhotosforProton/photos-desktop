 * Drive stores `Media.Duration` in SECONDS, and possibly fractional ones (a 7.5

 * milliseconds is the mistake this exists to prevent: it renders every video a
 * thousandth of its length, and making it the other way round renders a seven
 * second clip as two hours.
 *
 * The SDK hands back the whole attribute blob minus its `Common` block, so `Media`
 * sits at the top level. Casing varies between the clients that write it, and some
 * write the media fields flat, so both spellings and both shapes are read.
 *
 * Null for an image, for a video uploaded before the block existed, and for any
 * value that is not a positive number.
