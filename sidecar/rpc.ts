/**
 * Write one response line, and answer even when writing the intended one fails.
 *
 * The host admits one call at a time and blocks on the id it sent, so a request that
 * never gets a line back does not fail that one call: it strands the channel and hangs
 * the app with nothing to recover from. A payload that will not serialise therefore
 * still has to produce a line, carrying the same id so the host can retire the request.
 *
 * The fallback names the error's class only. What could not be serialised is a decrypted
 * result, and this text reaches both the log and the UI.
