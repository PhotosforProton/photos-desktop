// data every absolute path carries, before it can reach the on-disk log: PGP armor
// blocks, long base64 / base64url / hex runs (armored key bodies, session keys,
// tokens, passphrases), and the Windows account name. Extracted into its own module
// so it can be unit-tested without server.ts's stdio side effects.
