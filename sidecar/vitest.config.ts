// Proton's crypto packages ship TypeScript sources rather than built JavaScript,
// and Node will not strip types under node_modules. Vite transforms them instead,
// which is what lets a test import anything that reaches them.
//
// The openpgp alias is the build's, for the same reason `build.mjs` carries it:
// `@protontech/crypto` imports `openpgp/lightweight`, a subpath that only
// exports a browser build. Pointing it at openpgp's own entry keeps the tests
// on the Node build the sidecar actually ships.
//
// The SDK is taken from its source rather than its published build for the same
// reason: the build is CommonJS and keeps `.ts` in its own import paths, which
// Node refuses to load from node_modules. Its source is what `tsc` checks anyway.
