// Which files the app is offered for in Explorer, and the registry entries that say so.
//
// The installer compiles this same file rather than keeping a copy of it, the way it
// already does with `data_format.rs`. One copy matters more here than almost anywhere
// else, because the two ends are not symmetric: the installer can only ever put the
// registration IN, and the app's Settings switch is the only thing that can take it
// back out. Two lists that drifted apart would leave the installer claiming a type
// Settings then had no idea to remove, and two identities that drifted apart would
// leave the switch reading off while the machine carries the entries.
//
// Everything written here lives under `HKCU\Software\Classes`, the per-user half of
// `HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT`, which is what keeps the whole feature clear of administrator
// rights. Nothing goes to HKLM, and nothing claims the DEFAULT handler for a type:
// that choice is sealed behind a hash Windows verifies and belongs to the user.
//
// The two callers know different things, so the API asks each of them only for what it
// has. `register` names the executable outright: the installer passes the app
// inside the folder it has just written, the app passes its own `current_exe()`, and
// neither has to reconstruct the other's answer. `unregister` and `is_registered` take
// nothing at all, because both are keyed by the ProgId and not by a path, so the app
// can switch the association off without knowing where anything was installed.
