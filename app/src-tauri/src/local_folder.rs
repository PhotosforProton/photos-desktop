// The neighbours of a file opened from Explorer: the rest of its folder.
//
// A viewer launched over one file has no list behind it, so this builds the one Explorer
// itself would show, using the media types `local_file` already admits and the shell's own
// name order, and hands it back a page at a time.
//
// Two things are deliberate and both are about a folder with fifty thousand files in it.
// The listing is built once on a blocking thread and kept, so paging through it costs
// nothing more; and only a page ever crosses to the webview, so nothing here puts a
// hundred thousand names into the renderer's heap to draw fifteen tiles. The directory is
// sent once per page rather than repeated on every entry for the same reason.
//
// Sizes come from the directory scan itself, never from opening a file. That is what keeps
// this usable inside the Proton Photos folder: to the Cloud Filter driver an open that is
// not marked no-recall is a data access, so a listing that stat-ed each file would
// download the whole album to draw a filmstrip.
