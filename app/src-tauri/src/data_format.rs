// What the app's data directory holds, in one number.
//
// An upgrade replaces the app but leaves `<install>\data` where it is, so the
// sign-in, the settings and the caches survive it. That is only safe while the new
// app can still read what the old one wrote, and this is where that is declared:
// the app owns the number because the app defines the formats — the sealed key, the
// session, the vault, and the thumbnail and metadata caches.
//
// The installer compiles this same file. It holds nothing but the constants and
// imports nothing so that it can: a copy kept by hand would eventually drift from
// the app's, and this number decides whether a user keeps their sign-in.

/// Bump ONLY when this build cannot read a data directory an earlier build wrote.
/// The installer answers a bump by clearing the directory, which costs the user
/// their sign-in and every cached thumbnail, so an addition that older data
/// survives is not a reason to touch it. There has been one format so far.
pub const DATA_FORMAT: u32 = 1;

/// Names the file in the data directory that carries `DATA_FORMAT`, written by the
/// installer as it hands the folder to a build.
pub const FORMAT_STAMP: &str = "format.txt";
