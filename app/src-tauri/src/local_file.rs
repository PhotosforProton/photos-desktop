// Photos and videos that are already on this disk.
//
// Nothing here goes near the sidecar, and that is the whole point: double-clicking a
// file in Explorer must open it with no vault, no session and no password, so no step
// on this path may wait on the SDK process being up. The window already paints before
// the sidecar is ever contacted, so the only thing missing was a way in.
//
// Two surfaces reach the webview. An ordinary photo or video goes through Tauri's asset
// protocol, one admitted path at a time (`local_file_url`). A format the engine cannot
// draw is decoded by Windows itself and staged as a JPEG in the same folder the viewer's
// full-resolution originals already use (`decode_preview`), so the startup sweep that
// exists for those cleans these up too.
