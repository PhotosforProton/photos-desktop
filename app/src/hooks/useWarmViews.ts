/**
 * A first paint for the three views the shell does not keep mounted.
 *
 * The timeline gets this for free: the shell holds its items, so they survive a
 * trip to another tab and back. Albums, Shared and the trash live only while they
 * are on screen, so every visit used to start from nothing and show a shimmer
 * while its one fetch went out. This reads them once the timeline has settled and
 * hands each view something to paint on arrival.
 *
 * What it hands over is a first paint and nothing more. Every view still re-reads
 * on arrival, unconditionally, and reports the answer back here, so a snapshot is
 * never older than the last thing the server said and is never the last word. That
 * matters: the album list takes the endpoint route precisely so its counts and
 * covers cannot go stale (see the sidecar's albums module), and a snapshot allowed
 * to outlive a rename would hand that back. `reloadKey` drops all of it, so an
 * upload or a restore re-reads from scratch.
 *
 * Reading waits for `ready` and for the timeline to be the view on screen, so this
 * never competes with the grid the user is actually looking at.
