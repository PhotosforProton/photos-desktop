/**
 * Show the best available view of one photo, upgrading in place.
 *
 * The viewer has up to three views of the same photo, each sharper and slower to arrive
 * than the last: the grid thumbnail it already holds, the preview, and the photo's own
 * full-resolution bytes. `sources` lists them worst first; a source that has not
 * arrived yet is null.
 *
 * Two things make the upgrade invisible:
 *
 *  - Assigning a new URL to an <img> blanks it until the new bytes decode, which reads
 *    as a flash on every step up. So an upgrade is decoded off-screen first and only
 *    becomes the displayed source once it is ready to paint — the swap is then a single
 *    frame with no gap.
 *  - A candidate that cannot be decoded is dropped and whatever is on screen stays. That
 *    is also the honest answer for a format the engine cannot draw: no broken image, no
 *    message, the photo simply stays at the quality that did work.
 *
 * The FIRST source for a photo is shown straight away without waiting for a decode.
 * There is nothing to flash away from at that point, and the whole value of the cached
 * thumbnail is that it is instant.
 *
 * Downgrades are ignored: once a better source is showing, a worse one arriving late
 * (or a candidate reverting to null) cannot pull the quality back down.
