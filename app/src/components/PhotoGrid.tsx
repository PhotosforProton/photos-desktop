 * than counted, so the tier comes from what that column count stood for — how wide a
 * tile actually ends up.
 *
 * The thresholds are Android's own tile widths at its tier boundaries, on the 360dp
 * screen its grid is laid out for (20dp side insets, 6dp between columns):
 *
 *   3 columns -> (360 - 40 - 12) / 3 = 102.7dp   every badge
 *   4 columns -> (360 - 40 - 18) / 4 =  75.5dp   one secondary badge beside the cloud
 *   5 columns -> (360 - 40 - 24) / 5 =  59.2dp   the cloud badge alone
 *
 * A dp and a CSS pixel are one and the same here — the badges themselves are ported at
 * 1:1, an 18dp box as an 18px box — so those widths carry over unchanged.
