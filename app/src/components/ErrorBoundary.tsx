/**
 * The last thing between a failed render and a window with nothing in it.
 *
 * React answers an uncaught error during render by unmounting the whole tree. Both of
 * this app's real windows are frameless and transparent, so what that leaves on screen
 * is not a blank page but an empty pane of glass: no message, no controls, nothing to
 * say the app is even still running. It reads as a crash and is impossible to report.
 *
 * So this says what happened and offers the one thing that fixes it. The message is
 * shown rather than only logged, because the person looking at the window is the only
 * one who can say what they were doing when it went.
 *
 * Deliberately not translated. A fault in the dictionaries is exactly the kind of thing
 * that lands here, and a screen that fails to render its own apology helps nobody.
