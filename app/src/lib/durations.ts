/**
 * Video lengths for the grid's duration pill, loaded the way thumbnails are: a cell
 * asks when it scrolls into view, the asks are batched, and the answers are kept.
 *
 * A length is not in the timeline — it lives in the node's encrypted attributes — so
 * every one costs a node decrypt somewhere. Fetching per tile is what that would
 * become if each cell called on its own, so requests are coalesced into one call per
 * batch, and the sidecar answers most of them from its own encrypted cache anyway
 * (the Explorer mount and the search index fill the same entries). The pill simply
 * appears once the number arrives, so nothing waits on it.
 *
 * Cached without a bound, unlike thumbnails: a length is a small number rather than a
 * decoded image, so a whole library's worth is a rounding error against one thumbnail.
