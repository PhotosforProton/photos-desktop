/**
 * The viewer's last step: the photo's own full-resolution bytes.
 *
 * The preview above this one is a thumbnail — Proton's larger one, but still a
 * downscaled copy — so it is the ceiling on what the viewer can show. This fetches the
 * real file instead.
 *
 * The bytes arrive by one of two routes, chosen by the sidecar on size.
 *
 * An ordinary photo is held decrypted in the sidecar's memory and served through our
 * own `pfpview` scheme, so nothing decrypted is written to disk. It costs one pass over
 * the JSON-RPC channel, which is why the sidecar caps what may take it: measured at
 * 5.5 ms per MB here, a 16 MiB ceiling keeps that hold under the budget the host's
 * priority gate exists to defend. The URL names an unguessable token for the one photo
 * the viewer is on, and the sidecar drops the bytes the moment it steps away.
 *
 * A photo past that ceiling is streamed to a file in a staging folder instead and read
 * over Tauri's asset protocol. That protocol's reach is one glob in `tauri.conf.json`:
 * `$TEMP/pfp-view/*`. It is a single folder, non-recursive (Tauri's scope globs do not
 * cross a separator), nothing but our own staged files is ever written there, and the
 * sidecar deletes each one as soon as the viewer moves off it.
 *
 * The CSP grant for both is on `img-src` only: the webview may draw them, and may not
 * fetch, script, frame or style from them. No other filesystem access is opened
 * anywhere in the app.

 * The photo this side has actually asked the sidecar for an original of, or null when

 * sets it. So a photo that was never asked for provably has nothing on disk, and the
 * release for it is a call the sidecar answers by doing nothing, once it has queued
 * behind everything else on the one channel. Stepping through fifty photos used to send
 * fifty of those.
 *
 * Skipping the release for a photo this no longer names cannot strand a staged file
 * either: whatever displaced it here is a `getOriginal` for a different photo, and the
 * sidecar's own first act on one of those is to drop the previous original and delete
 * its file.

 * decode (HEIC, RAW, most TIFF) reports, and what a failed or abandoned transfer
 * reports. Every caller treats it the same way — keep the preview, say nothing.
 *
 * A photo kept offline settles on the very first call: its bytes are already in the
