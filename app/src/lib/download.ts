// What Download means, decided in one place.
//
// Either way the result is an ordinary file the rest of Windows can read, which is
// what separates Download from `offline.ts`: that one keeps the app's own encrypted
// copy and never writes to the Proton Photos folder. Nothing here is called offline.
//
// With the Explorer mount on, every photo already has a placeholder under the sync
// root, so Download fills that copy in and Windows marks it with the green check.
// With the mount off there is no placeholder to fill, so Download asks for a folder
// and writes the originals into it: ordinary files, carrying no cloud status because
// they are not placeholders and never were. Both are real modes.
//
// The host owns the preference, so every caller asks it here. Inferring the mode
// from anything the UI can see is what let the whole feature fail silently: with the
// mount off nothing is indexed, so the pin ran against an empty index, skipped every
// photo, and still reported the full count as downloaded.
