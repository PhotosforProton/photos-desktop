// This is the app's own copy, sealed in its own directory with the account's key. It
// is NOT the Explorer mount: nothing here ever appears under "Proton Photos" in File
// Explorer, and the two can be used together or apart. `download.ts` owns that other
// meaning of Download; keeping them in separate modules is what keeps them from being
// mistaken for one another.
//
// The sidecar owns the state, so this is a thin client over it plus one shared
// subscription: several views badge the same photos, and polling once for all of them
// keeps a single reader on the host's one RPC channel.
