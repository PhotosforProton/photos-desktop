 * means a video, its absence means nothing at all, because a file uploaded by a client
 * that set no tag carries none. Treating the missing tag as "not a video" is what left
 * uploads from this app unplayable and without a play icon.
 *
 * `undefined` means the media type has not been resolved yet, which is not the same as a
 * photo: a caller that must not guess can tell the two apart.
