/**
 * Media types, loaded the way the duration pills are: a cell asks when it scrolls into
 * view, the asks are batched, and the answers are kept.
 *
 * This is what makes a video a video here. The Videos tag says so when it is present, but
 * its absence says nothing at all: a file uploaded by a client that set no tag carries
 * none, and reading video-ness off the tag alone showed those as still photos that would
 * not play. The media type is the file's own account of itself, so it is right for
 * everything already in the library, whoever put it there and whenever.
 *
 * The timeline does not carry it. The server's listing returns capture time, hashes and
 * tags, and nothing more, so it costs a node lookup somewhere. Which is why nothing asks
 * for the whole library: cells ask for themselves as they come into view, the asks are
 * coalesced into one call per batch, and the sidecar answers most of them from its own
 * encrypted cache, which the search index, the Explorer mount and the duration resolver
 * all fill with the same entries.
 *
 * Cached without a bound, like the durations: a short string per photo is a rounding
 * error against a single decoded thumbnail.
